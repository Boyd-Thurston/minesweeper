      <h2>A little Bit About Naval Mines</h2>
      <P>
        Although minesweeper was created in the 60's and had its most notible release 
        on Windows 3.1 to promote early mouse use it had much more sinister origines. 
        During WWII naval mines were dropped enmass in various locations to hamper enemy 
        ship and submarine movements, not to mention blow a nasty big whole in anything 
        that did come into contact with them. So many of these self contained explosives 
        were dropped that not all have been recovered even today. The image in the 
        background was taken in 2014 when a naval mine reminaning from WWII was located and 
        detonated. Look at that explosion! Sitting in the water for approximately 70 years 
        when this photo was taken and it still packed a punch.
